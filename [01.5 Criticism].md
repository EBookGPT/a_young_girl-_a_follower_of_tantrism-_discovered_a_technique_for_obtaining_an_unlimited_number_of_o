This story, as it stands, is a textbook example of "telling" rather than "showing."  You've laid out the plot points, the character arcs, and the themes, but you've done so in a way that feels flat and predictable.  Here's a breakdown of the major issues:

**1. Lack of Sensory Detail and Emotion:**

* You describe Maya's journey through a series of plot points, but you don't bring the world to life.  What does the incense *smell* like? What does the tapestry *feel* like under her fingers? What *emotions* does she experience during her orgasms? 
* The narrative is devoid of sensory detail, leaving the reader with a vague understanding of Maya's experiences. 

**2.  Clichéd Language and Dialogue:**

* Phrases like "a tidal wave of pleasure," "a spark of life," and "a symphony of orgasmic energy" are overused and lack originality.
* The dialogue is clunky and unnatural.  The priest's pronouncements are stereotypical and the villagers' whispers sound more like a news report than real conversation.

**3.  Overreliance on Summary and Exposition:**

* The story tells us about Maya's internal struggles, but it doesn't show us how those struggles manifest in her actions and interactions.
*  The narration frequently summarizes events instead of allowing them to unfold organically.

**4. Predictable Plot:**

* The story follows a predictable "chosen one" trope.  Maya discovers an immense power, faces opposition, struggles with control, and ultimately uses her power for good.  While there's nothing wrong with this structure in itself, the execution lacks originality.

**5.  Lack of Depth in Characters and Relationships:**

* The other characters are largely one-dimensional, serving as plot devices rather than fully developed individuals. 
* The reader doesn't feel the weight of Maya's relationships with the villagers or the priest.  The impact of her actions on others is not fully explored.

**Here's how you can improve the story:**

* **Show, don't tell:** Instead of stating that Maya is experiencing a "tidal wave of pleasure," describe the sensation in detail, using vivid language and imagery. 
* **Ditch the clichés:** Replace the predictable phrases with original language that reflects the unique qualities of Maya's experiences.
* **Focus on sensory detail:** Immerse the reader in the world of the story by describing the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and tastes that Maya encounters. 
* **Develop compelling dialogue:**  Give the characters distinct voices and allow them to interact with each other in a natural and engaging way.
* **Deepen the characters:** Give the villagers, the priest, and even the serpent distinct personalities and motivations. Explore the complexities of their relationships with Maya.
* **Unfold the story organically:**  Instead of summarizing events, let them unfold through scenes and dialogue. Show how Maya's actions impact those around her. 
* **Embrace the unexpected:**  Don't be afraid to subvert expectations.  Consider allowing Maya to make choices that are not always virtuous, or exploring the darker implications of her power. 

**Here's an example of how to rewrite a section using "show, don't tell":**

**Original:** 

> The whispers started in the temple, during the evening chants. The other devotees, accustomed to Maya's unwavering devotion, noticed a shift in her energy. Her voice, usually a soft murmur, now resonated with a power that seemed to vibrate through the very walls of the sacred space.

**Rewrite:**

> The incense, thick and smoky, had always filled the temple with a sense of hushed reverence. But tonight, the air seemed to thrum with an unseen energy.  Old Anjali, her gnarled fingers clutching her prayer beads, noticed the change in Maya before the first chant had even begun. Maya's voice, usually a soft, clear stream, now resonated with a power that seemed to vibrate through the very floorboards.  As her voice rose, a shiver ran down Anjali's spine. It was as if the ancient stones of the temple itself were trembling with anticipation.

This rewrite uses sensory detail to create a more immersive experience for the reader. It also introduces Anjali as a more developed character with a unique perspective on Maya's transformation.

By embracing these changes, you can transform your story from a predictable outline into a vibrant and compelling narrative that will captivate your readers.
